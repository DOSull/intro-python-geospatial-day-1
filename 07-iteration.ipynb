Because the condition is fulfilled, the computer executes the block inside the `while` construct, `print(x)`, and then updates `x` to `x + 1` i.e., `1`. Then it loops back to the top and test the `x < 10` condition again. Since `x` is still less than `10`, the loop is executed again, this time increasing `x` to `2`.
