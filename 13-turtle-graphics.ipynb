    "# Turtles all the way down!\n",
    "This notebook uses a notebook-friendly implementation of core elements of the [Python `turtle` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) to encourage you to explore simple iteration and function building. The re-implementation is rather limited - it only really supports the basic pen-up, pen-down, forward, right, left operations. But that's enough to make some fun pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "I downloaded the `jupyturtle.py` file that contains the relevant functions from [this repository](https://github.com/fluentpython/jupyturtle2), so that I could make some tweaks for our purposes&mdash;minor things like a larger canvas, finer pen, and such like. Full credit to [Luciano Ramalho](https://github.com/fluentpython) (see also https://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/l/luciano-ramalho) for development of the module. An earlier version of the module is available for pip installation, but doesn't seem to allow for the minor tweaks I wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it's not provided in the module, and it's handy to have, I've added a `jump_to()` function which let's you pick the turtle up and drop it a new spot, which you might find useful. You can also use this to figure out how the coordinates of the turtle space are organised."

To get started, we get ourselves a turtle, who we will refer to by the name `tash`."
