# import the turtle module
import turtle

# define a function to draw a square using turtle t
def square(t):
    print("Replace this print statement with code to get t to draw a square")



# You could write other functions here if you want, e.g
def polygon(t, n):
    # code to use turtle t to draw a polygon with nsides sides




# Now main code of the script
# make a turtle
kiwi = turtle.Turtle()

# call the function
square(kiwi)
